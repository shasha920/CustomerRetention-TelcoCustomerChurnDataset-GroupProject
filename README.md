*Executive Summary*<br>

*The purpose of this project is to examine churn triggers on customers that decide to terminate their telecom contracts for better price offers and/or more interesting packages from competitors, bad service experiences, change of customer’s personal situations. The case study analyzed is a telecommunication company (known as Telco company) provides subscription- based telecommunication service, which is its major revenue source. The segments are defined in twenty-one different customer attributes based on “Customer Demographics Information”, “Customer Account Information”, and “Customer Service Booked”. The results indicate Telco customers with high technology habits have tendencies of terminating their contracts (aka churn) and customers with longer contracts, long tenure records tend to have more loyalty.*<br>

*According to Harvard Business Review, acquiring a new customer could be 5 to 25 times more expensive than keeping an existing one. Therefore, companies with a huge market such as telecom companies, prioritizing customer retention allows the company to maintain its existing market in an economic way. Customer churning is essential in this process. Understanding what variables and qualities of the products attract customers to stay is vital. The research done in this case study analyzes different customer performances. For more business insights, please refer to page 18. In telecoms, the churn rate refers to the percentage of customers who terminate their contract or subscription with the company. A high churn rate means low loyalty to their service. According to CustomerGauge B2B NPS and CX Benchmarks report, the telecom industry has an average retention rate of 69%. It is observed that acquiring new customers can be more expensive for companies as compared to retention of an existing customer (Athanassopoulos, 2000).*<br>

*The case study concludes using e-mail notification is essential to build a customer relationship, sending promotional e-mails, loyal customers tend to spend more money. Telcom should focus on giving these customers promotional deals to keep them satisfied. Customers who use automatic payments are shown to be more dependable customers’ long term. Lastly, companies with few outages do not get negative press, this will attract customers to stay.*<br>
